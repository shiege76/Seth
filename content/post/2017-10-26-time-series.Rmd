Time Series graphs are related to scatter plots but the main difference is that time series shows a change over time or a trend. 

```{r}
# Extraction----------------------------

query<-"SELECT yearID,HR
FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"

result<-sqldf(query)

# Visualization-------------------------

ggplot()+
  #geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Ruth's Homerun Totals Throughout the Years")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Homeruns")

```

The Graph above shows Babe Ruths Homerun total throughout his career.
