A histogram is a graphical representation, similar to a bar chart in structure, that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges. The histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins.


```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight
FROM Master"

result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="green",fill="white",bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Body Weight Distribution for Baseball Players")
```
