```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#Extractcing Data----------------------------

query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR ,sum(SO) AS career_SO 
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>=400"

result<-sqldf(query)

#Visulaizing Data----------------------------

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR), size=3, color="blue")+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts vs. Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
  xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Career Homerunes")
```

In the above chart, I created a scatter plot using career strikeouts as the x-axis and career homeurns as the y-axis. I changed the color and the size of the dots making them size 3 and color blue.
